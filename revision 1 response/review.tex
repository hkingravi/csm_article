\centerline{{\bf \large Statement of Revision}}

In the following, we provide an account of the changes that have been made
in order to address the concerns of the reviewers.  The nature of
the review for this paper is such that the comments were provided both
in paragraph form and in bulleted form.  When addressing the paragraph
form, we have identify the comment using the notation {\bf {\color{red}(Rx:Py)}} where 
{\bf x} is the Reviewer number and {\bf y} is paragraph referred to.
When addressing the bullet form, we utilize the form {\bf (Rx:z)} where
{\bf x} identifies the Reviewer and {\bf z} identifies the bulleted comment.
Each bulleted comment included in the listing is followed by a description
of modifications to the paper addressing the comment. Furthermore, changes in the paper have been marked with a color coding.  We hope that this
method is sufficiently clear.
We would like to thank the reviewers for their time and effort at providing
feedback in order to improve the exposition of the paper.

{\bf Comments by Associate Editor.}

In this paper the authors provide an overview of methods and algorithms
to build data-driven models that may be used for estimation and
prediction of spatio-temporal processes. 

Four reviews were obtained for this paper. In general, the reviewers
agree that the topic of this paper is of interest to the control
community, and that the proposed approach appears sound. However, the
reviewers point out a number of serious concerns, in particular:

Comparison with the state of the art: the comparison with the state
of the art appears insufficient (see Reviewers 5, 6, and 7). This makes
the contribution of this paper unclear (see Reviewer 6).

Presentation style and rigor: the presentation style is quite poor
(see Reviewers 5, 6, 7, and 9). In particular, the paper contains
several typos and the presentation of the results is rather dense. Most
importantly, the authors refer to an Appendix for the presentation of
the proofs of the theoretical results; however, such an Appendix is
missing. Collectively, these shortcomings make this paper very
difficult to read and evaluate -- see, in particular, Reviewer 7.
Furthermore, note that CSM papers do not have appendices, 
so the location of these proofs will have to be changed.

Tutorial contribution: the insufficient comparison with the state of
the art, the poor presentation style, and the lack of proofs for the
theoretical results make the tutorial value of this paper quite weak.
In other words, it would be very difficult for a practitioner to use
this paper as a guide for developing estimation and prediction
algorithms for spatio-temporal processes (when should one use the
methods presented in this paper? are there implementation guidelines?
etc.). The authors do reference a software library - in my opinion,
this paper should more explicitly reference such a library in order to
better explain the practical and implementation aspects of the proposed
methodology.

 I concur with the reviewersâ€™ comments and I recommend that the authors
prepare a significantly revised version addressing all the
concerns and suggestions, with a key focus on strengthening the
tutorial value of the paper. In addition, the authors should address
the following comments:

{\color{red}(AE:1)} We thank the associate editor for the opportunity to submit a revision.  We have prepared a significant revision that includes the complete proofs of all of the results presented in this paper. 


The sidebar "Key control problems in agriculture," while
interesting, appears excessively long. The authors should shorten it,
and make its relevance to the topic of this paper clearer.

{\color{red}(AE:2)} We have reduced the key control problems sidebar. We have significantly reduced the length of the sidebar by reducing the general discussion about agriculture. We have focused instead the sidebar on the challenges in spatiotemporal estimation for advancing agricultural robotics.


The quality of many of the figures is quite low (see, for example,
Figure 1, Figure 8, and Figure S8). The authors should make all figures
clearly readable.

{\bf Comments by Referee 1. reviewer ID 4665}

{\color{red}(R1:P1)} This paper describes an approach, developed by the authors over the
previous few years, to build data-driven models that may be used for
estimation and prediction within spatiotemporal monitoring. The model
is based on predicting a process that evolves in an RKHS, where finite
dimensional measurements are available. Given these measurements and a
choice of kernel, approximation methods for the feature space may be
developed (via e.g. a dictionary of atoms, random fourier features,
etc). Then, given the measurements, a linear dynamical system may be
constructed in the feature space. This finite dimensional feature
evolution may be analyzed from the point of view of linaer systems
theory, and theoretical results on observability and estimation are
stated. 

{\color{red} Response:} The authors thank the anonymous reviewer for his succinct and accurate evaluation of this paper.


{\color{red}(R1:P2)} While I believe this paper is coherent and reasonably strong, there are
a few ways in which it could be improved. 

First, the technique of finding an alternate space in which the state
evolves linearly is not novel (nor is it claimed to be). The paper
would benefit from an extended discussion and comparison to alternative
methods. In particular there has recently been considerable interest in
methods inspired by Koopman analysis, which the authors mention only
extrememly briefly, in passing. Since the authors present experiments
on fluid flow problems, they should present comparisons to dynamic mode
decomposition, which has been a popular technique and has many
similarities to the method presented in this work. See, e.g.,
Schmid, Peter J. "Dynamic mode decomposition of numerical and
experimental data." Journal of fluid mechanics 656 (2010): 5-28.
and the many articles that cite the above. Moreover, there is a broad
literature extending dynamic mode decomposition and other
Koopman-inspired techniques. In particular, one may refer to the work
of Steve Brunton and Nathan Kutz, such as 
Brunton, Steven L., Joshua L. Proctor, and J. Nathan Kutz. "Discovering
governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear
dynamical systems." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
113.15 (2016): 3932-3937.

While these works do not explicitly discuss the estimation problem,
comparisons between the chosen model and those discussed above would
greatly improve the paper and allow readers to better appreciate and
situate the proposed methods within the literature. 

{\color{red}(Response)} We have included an extensive discussion of this method in view of Koopman operator theory. We have also included a comparison of the modes discovered by this method to those obtained via dynamic mode decomposition. We have also included recent research into how the modes can be used to generate best paths for moving agents seeking to infer the current state of the system.

{\color{red}(R1:P3)} In addition the above, I was confused by the presentation of the
theoretical results. I could not find the appendix in which proof of
the theoretical results was presented, and so have not been able to
review them. 

{\color{red}(Response)}

{\color{red}(R1:P4)} The evolving GP formulation, in which dynamics are shared across
dynamical systems should not behave similarly, was confusing. In
particular, the definition of similar fluid systems seems ad hoc, and
this section must be better motivated and explained in general.

{\color{red}(R1:P5)} Minor comments
\gXX{when you have addressed the comment, remove the red lining}
---------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item page 1 line 10, "spatiotemporally" misspelled
\item page 4 line 24 "interpretability" misspelled
\item text very small in figure 8, figure 10, figure S8. Generally, the
text size of the figures needs to be fixed throughout. \gXX{Josh, Harshals}
\end{enumerate}

{\color{red}(Response)} Thank you for pointing out these typos; they have been fixed.
