\section{Author Biography}
%Insert the author bios here.

\noindent \textbf{Harshal Maske} completed his PhD in 2018 from the University
of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, he is currently a postdoc at UIUC. He received his Masters
and Bachelors integrated degree in Mechanical
Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology
Kharagpur, India, in 2009. After completing his
masters, he worked for three years at Defense R\&D
Organization (2009-2012), India and for one year
at John Deere (2012-2013). His current research is
grounded in the theory at the intersection of Controls
and Machine learning with the aim of developing
data driven models with theoretical guarantees that
enable decision making and control in real-world, complex problems.

\noindent \textbf{Hassan A. Kingravi}  is a senior data scientist Eqifax, where he conducts research on machine
learning and signal processing for the purposes of
preventing fraud in the retail and financial sectors. He was previously with Pindrop.
His research interests revolve around the interplay
of control theory, signal processing, and machine
learning for spatiotemporal data. He received his PhD in Electrical and
Computer Engineering from the Georgia Institute
of Technology in 2014 and did a postdoc at Oklahoma State University with Chowdhary's group.



\noindent \textbf{Joshua Whitman} is a PhD student at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. He received Bachelors of Science degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from Oklahoma State University in 2015, and his Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois in 2018. His research is centered in the fields of machine learning, controls, and autonomy, and his work focuses on developing new methods for learning, monitoring, and controlling the dynamics of complex spatiotemporally-evolving systems.

\noindent \textbf{Girish Chowdhary} is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and affiliated with Electrical and Computer Engineering, Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Computer Science, Aerospace Engineering, and is a member of the UIUC Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL). He is the director of the Distributed Autonomous Systems laboratory and the Field Robotics Engineering and Science Hub (FRESH) at UIUC. He holds a PhD (2010) from Georgia Institute of Technology in Aerospace Engineering. He was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for about two years (2011-2013). He was an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University's Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department (2013-2016). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he also worked with the German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) Institute of Flight Systems for around three years (2003-2006). His undergraduate institution was the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia. Girish's ongoing research interest is in theoretical insights and practical algorithms for adaptive autonomy with applications in field robotics.
