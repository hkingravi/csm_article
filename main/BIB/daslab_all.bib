  Abstract                 = {An analog system for fixed point computation is described. The system is derived from a continuous time analog of the classical over-relaxed fixed point iteration. The dynamical system is proved to converge for nonexpansive mappings under all p norms, p isin;(1, infin;). This extends previously established results to not necessarily differentiable maps which are nonexpansive under the infin;-norm. The system will always converge to a single fixed point in a connected set of fixed points. This allows the system to function as a complementary paradigm to energy minimization techniques for optimization in the analog domain. It is shown that the proposed technique is applicable to a large class of dynamic programming computations},

This new architecture has a low-pass filter in the feedback loop and relies on the small-gain theorem for the proof of asymptotic stability. The tools from this paper can be used to develop a theoretically justified verification and validation framework for adaptive systems. Simulations illustrate the theoretical findings.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a new generation of hypersonic vehicles offers a far more effective way of launching small satellites or other vehicles into low-Earth orbit than expendable rockets. Additionally these aircraft facilitate quick response and global strike capabilities. Control of hypersonic vehicles is challenging due to the changes in the aircraft dynamics as the manuever takes the aircraft over large flight envelopes.The field of adaptive control began with the motivation that a controller that can adjust its parameters online could generate improved performance over a fixed-parameter counterpart. Subsequently, sobering lessons of tradeoffs between stability and performance directed the evolution of the field toward the design, analysis, and synthesis of stable adaptive systems. Various adaptive control methods have been developed for controlling linear and nonlinear dynamic systems with parametric and dynamic uncertainties.With the benefit of hindsight and subsequent research, the paper revisit the events of 1967 by examining "how and what if" scenarios.we analyze the X-15-3 aircraft dynamics and the Honeywell MH-96 adaptive controller in an effort to better understand how the sequence of events and the interplay between the controller and the aircraft dynamics might have led to the instability and resulting crash. It follows with a depiction of a Lyapunov-stability-based adaptive controller that incorporates gain scheduling and accommodates actuator magnitude saturation, which we denote as the gain-scheduled, magnitude-saturation-accommodating.},

  Abstract                 = {Customary modeling for continuous point-referenced data assumes a Gaussian process that is often taken to be stationary. When such models are fitted within a Bayesian framework, the unknown parameters of the process are assumed to be random, so a random Gaussian process results. Here we propose a novel spatial Dirichlet process mixture model to produce a random spatial process that is neither Gaussian nor stationary. We first develop a spatial Dirichlet process model for spatial data and discuss its properties. Because of familiar limitations associated with direct use of Dirichlet process models, we introduce mixing by convolving this process with a pure error process. We then examine properties of models created through such Dirichlet process mixing. In the Bayesian framework, we implement posterior inference using Gibbs sampling. Spatial prediction raises interesting questions, but these can be handled. Finally, we illustrate the approach using simulated data, as well as a dataset involving precipitation measurements over the Languedoc-Roussillon region in southern France.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

  Abstract                 = {The acquisition and improvement of motor skills and control policies for robotics from trial and error is of essential importance if robots should ever leave precisely pre-structured environments. However, to date only few existing reinforcement learning methods have been scaled into the domains of high-dimensional robots such as manipulator, legged or humanoid robots. Policy gradient methods remain one of the few exceptions and have found a variety of applications. Nevertheless, the application of such methods is not without peril if done in an uninformed manner. In this paper, we give an overview on learning with policy gradient methods for robotics with a strong focus on recent advances in the field. We outline previous applications to robotics and show how the most recently developed methods can significantly improve learning performance. Finally, we evaluate our most promising algorithm in the application of hitting a baseball with an anthropomorphic arm},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we evaluate different versions from the three main kinds of model-free policy gradient methods, i.e., finite difference gradients, 'vanilla' policy gradients and natural policy gradients. Each of these methods is first presented in its simple form and subsequently refined and optimized. By carrying out numerous experiments on the cart pole regulator benchmark we aim to provide a useful baseline for future research on parameterized policy search algorithms. Portable C++ code is provided for both plant and algorithms; thus, the results in this paper can be reevaluated, reused and new algorithms can be inserted with ease},

  Abstract                 = {{RoboCup} simulated soccer presents many challenges to reinforcement learning methods, including a large state space, hidden and uncertain state, multiple independent agents learning simultaneously, and long and variable delays in the effects of actions. We describe our application of episodic {SMDP} Sarsa(?) with linear tile-coding function approximation and variable ? to learning higher-level decisions in a keepaway subtask of {RoboCup} soccer. In keepaway, one team, ?the keepers,? tries to keep control of the ball for as long as possible despite the efforts of ?the takers.? The keepers learn individually when to hold the ball and when to pass to a teammate. Our agents learned policies that significantly outperform a range of benchmark policies. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it to a number of task variations including different field sizes and different numbers of players on each team.},

  Abstract                 = {Neural networks have been extensively used for adaptive system identification as well as adaptive and neuroadaptive control of highly uncertain systems. The goal of adaptive and neuroadaptive control is to achieve system performance without excessive reliance on system models. To improve robustness and the speed of adaptation of adaptive and neuroadaptive controllers several controller architectures have been proposed in the literature. In this dissertation, we developed a new neuroadaptive control architecture for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems as well as nonlinear nonnegative uncertain dynamical systems. Nonnegative systems are essential in capturing the behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems involving dynamic states whose values are nonnegative. A subclass of nonnegative dynamical systems are compartmental systems. These systems are derived from mass and energy balance considerations and are comprised of homogeneous interconnected microscopic subsystems or compartments which exchange variable quantities of material via intercompartmental flow laws. In this research, we developed a direct adaptive and neuroadaptive control framework for stabilization, disturbance rejection and noise suppression for nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with exogenous system disturbances. Furthermore, we developed a new neuroadaptive control architecture for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems. Specifically, the proposed framework involves a new and novel controller architecture involving additional terms, or Q-modification terms, in the update laws that are constructed using a moving time window of the integrated system uncertainty. The Q-modification terms can be used to identify the ideal neural network system weights which can be used in the adaptive law. In addition, these terms effectively suppress system uncertainty. Finally, neuroadaptive output feedback control architecture for nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems with input amplitude and integral constraints is developed. This architecture is used to control lung volume and minute ventilation with input pressure constraints that also accounts for spontaneous breathing by the patient. Specifically, we develop a pressure- and work-limited neuroadaptive controller for mechanical ventilation based on a nonlinear multi-compartmental lung model. The control framework does not rely on any averaged data and is designed to automatically adjust the input pressure to the patient's physiological characteristics capturing lung resistance and compliance modeling uncertainty. Moreover, the controller accounts for input pressure constraints as well as work of breathing constraints. The effect of spontaneous breathing is incorporated within the lung model and the control framework.},

  Abstract                 = {The force tracking error is dependent on both the position tracking error and the estimated parameter error so that, in constrained adaptive robot control, the convergence of the estimated parameter error becomes more important than in unconstrained adaptive robot control. However, in the direct adaptive controller, the parameter adaptation is driven only by the tracking error in the joint motion, while in the indirect adaptive controller, the parameter estimation is driven only by the prediction error in the joint torque. Based on this observation a new combined direct and indirect adaptive controller driven by both the tracking error and the prediction error is developed for constrained robots with inertia parameter uncertainty. Stability of the combined adaptive controllers is established in the Lyapunov sense. The combined control improves both position and force tracking performance compared with direct adaptive control. The computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the proposed schemes. },

Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here.},

  	Abstract = {Autonomous robotic weed control systems hold promise toward the automation of one of agriculture's few remaining unmechanized and drudging tasks, hand weed control. Robotic technology may also provide a means of reducing agriculture's current dependency on herbicides, improving its sustainability and reducing its environmental impact. This review describes the current status of the four core technologies (guidance, detection and identification, precision in-row weed control, and mapping) required for the successful development of a general-purpose robotic system for weed control. Of the four, detection and identification of weeds under the wide range of conditions common to agricultural fields remains the greatest challenge. A few complete robotic weed control systems have demonstrated the potential of the technology in the field. Additional research and development is needed to fully realize this potential.},

  	Abstract = {Agricultural weed management has become entrenched in a single tactic---herbicide---resistant crops---and needs greater emphasis on integrated practices that are sustainable over the long term. In response to the outbreak of glyphosate-resistant weeds, the seed and agrichemical industries are developing crops that are genetically modified to have combined resistance to glyphosate and synthetic auxin herbicides. This technology will allow these herbicides to be used over vastly expanded areas and will likely create three interrelated challenges for sustainable weed management. First, crops with stacked herbicide resistance are likely to increase the severity of resistant weeds. Second, these crops will facilitate a significant increase in herbicide use, with potential negative consequences for environmental quality. Finally, the short-term fix provided by the new traits will encourage continued neglect of public research and extension in integrated weed management. Here, we discuss the risks to sustainable agriculture from the new resistant crops and present alternatives for research and policy.},
