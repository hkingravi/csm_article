	readily interpreted as system uncertainties, and thus can be incorporated
	within the standard modern robust control framework. Previous research
	has focused on several classes of nonlinearities, including time
	invariant, (odd) monotonic, and locally slope-restricted functions,
	to capture the real parameter uncertainty problem. The purpose of
	this note is to investigate absolute stability results for constant,

@article{Feder_IJRR_1999,
	Abstract = {The task of building a map of an unknown environment and concurrently
	using that map to navigate is a central problem in mobile robotics
	research. This paper addresses the problem of how to perform concurrent
	mapping and localization (CML) adaptively using sonar. Stochastic
	mapping is a feature-based approach to CML that generalizes the extended
	Kalman filter to incorporate vehicle localization and environmental
	mapping. The authors describe an implementation of stochastic mapping
	that uses a delayed nearest neighbor data association strategy to
	initialize new features into the map, match measurements to map features,
	and delete out-of-date features. The authors introduce a metric for
	adaptive sensing that is defined in terms of Fisher information and
	represents the sum of the areas of the error ellipses of the vehicle
	and feature estimates in the map. Predicted sensor readings and expected
	dead-reckoning errors are used to estimate the metric for each potential
	action of the robot, and the action that yields the lowest cost (i.e.,
	the maximum information) is selected. This technique is demonstrated
	via simulations, in-air sonar experiments, and underwater sonar experiments.
	Results are shown for (1) adaptive control of motion and (2) adaptive
	control of motion and scanning. The vehicle tends to explore selectively
	different objects in the environment. The performance of this adaptive
	algorithm is shown to be superior to straight-line motion and random
	motion.},

	Annote = {We introduce a class of Lyapunov functionals for analyzing hybrid
	dynamical systems. This class can be thought of as a generalization
	of the Lyapunov functional introduced by Yakubovich (1965) for systems
	with hysteresis nonlinearities which incorporates path integrals
	that account for the energy loss or gain every time a hysteresis
	loop is traversed. Hence, these Lyapunov functionals capture the
	path-dependence of the \&ldquo;stored energy\&rdquo; in hybrid dynamical
	systems and are therefore less conservative over previously published
	approaches in analyzing such systems. More importantly, we show that
	searching over the proposed class of Lyapunov functionals to prove
	some specification (e.g., stability) can be cast as a semidefinite
	program (SDP), which can then be efficiently solved (globally) using
	widely available software. Examples are presented to show the effectiveness
	of this class of Lyapunov functionals in analyzing hybrid dynamical
	systems},

	adaptive FIR equalizers over a time-varying wireless channel. The
	channel is assumed to be frequency selective with Rayleigh fading.
	The proposed equalizer structure consists of the series connection
	of an adaptive FIR filter and a fixed equalizer (designed for the
	nominal channel). Adaptation of the weight vector of the adaptive
	FIR filter is achieved using the H<sub>\&infin;</sub>-optimal solution
	of an estimation-based interpretation of the channel equalization
	problem. Due to its H<sub>\&infin;</sub>-optimality, the proposed
	solution is robust to exogenous disturbances, and enables fast adaptation
	(i.e., a short training period) without compromising the steady-state
	performance of the equalization. Preliminary simulation are presented
	to support the above claims},

	presents LMI-based algorithms that explicitly synthesize robust controllers

	have fewer poles than the plant. This reduction is accomplished by
	treating the controller order as part of a multi-objective optimization.
	As expected, the reduced controllers typically achieve degraded performance
	as the order is reduced. This trade-off is explored in the paper
	using three design approaches: H<sub>\&infin;</sub>, robust H<sub>\&infin;</sub>,
	and Popov/H<sub>\&infin; </sub> design techniques, and the results
	are presented using trade off curves for a typical benchmark problem.
	The reduced order design algorithms are useful in the cases when

	Abstract = {Statistical learning theory was introduced in the late 1960's. Until
	the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of
	function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle
	of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector
	machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made
	statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis
	but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating
	multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general
	overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical
	and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview
	is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions
	for generalization which are more general than those discussed in
	classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these
	conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation
	problems},

	application to a separated spacecraft interferometer. A multi-layer
	control design that achieves very accurate alignment between spacecraft
	is described. Sensing for this control architecture is based on a
	global real-time relative position and orientation estimator that
	uses carrier differential-phase GPS measurements. A local optical
	sensor is used as well. The experiments are performed on a fully
	functional indoor GPS environment using three prototype spacecraft
	on a granite table. Work continues on extending the control to a
	formation of three active vehicles and on extending the sensing system
	to a self-constellation },

	Abstract = {We show how linear matrix inequalities (LMI) can be used to perform
	local stability and performance analysis of linear systems with saturating
	elements. This leads to less conservative information on stability
	regions, disturbance rejection, and L<sub>2</sub>-gain than standard
	global stability and performance analysis. The circle and Popov criteria
	are used to obtain Lyapunov functions whose sublevel sets provide
	regions of guaranteed stability and performance within a restricted
	state space region. Our LMI formulation leads directly to simple
	convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently as semidefinite
	programs. The results cover both single and multiple saturation elements
	and can be immediately extended to discrete time systems. An obvious
	application of these techniques is in the analysis of control systems
	with saturating control inputs},

	robust H<sub>2</sub> controller synthesis problem and analyzes the
	convergence properties of the algorithm on several examples. It is
	difficult to make concrete statements about the behavior of the iterative
	algorithms, except that it is often conjectured that the cost in
	each step of the solution procedure is reduced, which implies that
	the algorithms should converge to a local minimum. Similar difficulties
	exist for the new LMI-based iterative algorithm that we have recently
	proposed (1997) to solve the bilinear matrix inequalities that occur
	in robust H<sub>2</sub> control design. The effectiveness of the
	new algorithm has already been demonstrated on several numerical
	examples. This paper verifies that it efficiently converges to the
	optimal solution. In the process, we provide some new key insights
	on the proposed design technique which indicate that it exhibits
	properties similar to the D-K iteration of the complex \&mu;/K<sub>m</sub>-synthesis

	Annote = {This paper presents new finite-dimensional linear matrix inequality
	(LMI) formulations for the stability and induced L<sub>2</sub> performance
	analysis of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. The approach
	is based on the nonsmooth, dissipative system theory using a continuous,
	piecewise affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov function (PAPDLF).
	The new method is shown to be less conservative than previously published
	techniques that are based on either affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov
	functions or robust control techniques. Conservatism is reduced with
	this new approach because the analysis is performed over several,
	smaller subregions of the parameter space rather than the entire
	region. The new analysis approach also uses a more general class
	of parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. In contrast to the gridding
	approach typically used to develop a computationally feasible algorithm,
	this proposed approach guarantees the analysis result. While computationally
	intensive, we show that the numerical results using our approach
	can be used to develop many new insights into the potential conservatism
	of various classes of Lyapunov functions for LPV systems},

	control. Of particular interest are the performance characteristics
	and limitations of the filtered-x LMS (FXLMS) algorithm. The augmented
	error algorithm and combination feedback/feedforward control are
	two means investigated to extend the capabilities of FXLMS by desensitizing
	the algorithm to the specific dynamics of the plant. Several experiments
	were conducted on a laboratory testbed which serves as the prototype

@conference{Banjerdpongchai_ACC97,
	Annote = {This paper presents a new algorithm for designing full order LTI
	controllers for systems with real parametric uncertainty. The approach
	is based on the robust L<sub>2</sub> gain analysis of the Lur'e system
	using Popov analysis and multipliers. The core algorithm, previously
	applied to the robust \&Hscr;<sub>2</sub> performance synthesis problem,
	is shown to be applicable to the robust controller design with the
	\&Hscr;<sub>\&infin;</sub> cost. Although the performance metrics
	are different, we demonstrate that the same solution algorithm based
	on LMI synthesis leads to a very effective and efficient technique
	for real parametric robust \&Hscr;<sub>\&infin;</sub> control design.
	Furthermore, it is difficult to compare robust \&Hscr;<sub>2</sub>
	controllers to \&mu;/K<sub>m</sub> designs, but in this work we provide
	insights into the issue of conservatism for various robust \&Hscr;<sub>\&infin;</sub>
	control approaches, in particular, the Popov controller synthesis,
	the robust \&Hscr;<sub>\&infin;</sub> design, and the \&mu;/K<sub>m</sub>
	synthesis. The detailed analysis of these approaches is demonstrated

	Annote = {This paper presents a new, combined analysis and synthesis procedure
	that provides an efficient and effective robust control design technique
	for systems with real parametric uncertainty. Robust stability is
	determined for these systems using passivity analysis with generalized
	multipliers, and the worst case \&Hscr;<sub>2</sub> performance is
	investigated using a bound on the output energy. The dynamics of
	the multipliers are systematically chosen using knowledge from the
	uncertain system. The synthesis objective of minimizing the robust
	performance naturally leads to bilinear matrix inequalities, which
	can be decoupled to a large extent. A heuristic, iterative algorithm
	is presented to handle the residual coupling in the design problem.
	A simple beam example is used to demonstrate that the synthesis with
	generalized multipliers leads to less conservative controllers for
	systems with real parametric uncertainty},

	Abstract = {The middeck active control experiment (MACE) is a space shuttle flight
	experiment intended to demonstrate high authority active structural
	control in zero gravity (0-g) conditions based on analysis and ground
	testing. Finite element structural models are very important for
	the MACE program because they can be used to predict the on-orbit
	dynamics of the test article. However, finite element models tend
	to be inaccurate, requiring the use of parametric robust control
	techniques to achieve good performance. Several such control techniques
	and an overall design methodology are discussed in this paper. Experimental
	results from several tests are used to illustrate the feasibility
	of achieving good H<sub>2</sub> performance on the test article with
	robust controllers based on the finite element model. This demonstration
	improves confidence in the eventual on-orbit performance of this
	experiment and other future spacecraft},

	Annote = {Robust performance analysis plays an important role in the design
	of controllers for uncertain multivariable systems. Recent research
	has investigated the use of absolute stability criteria to develop
	less conservative analysis tests for systems with linear and nonlinear
	real parameter uncertainties. This note extends previous work on
	optimal \&Hscr;2 performance analysis using the Popov criterion by
	presenting a numerical homotopy algorithm that can be used to analyze
	systems with less restrictive assumptions on the structure of the
	uncertainty block. The technique is used to compare relative robustness
	capabilities of the various control algorithms that have been designed
	for the Middeck active control experiment (MACE). The analysis is
	combined with the previously presented Popov controller synthesis
	to yield compensators that guarantee robust performance for systems

	problem is performed which provides a means by which a finite element
	model and identified frequency and mode shape information can be
	converted to mass and stiffness matrix perturbations required to
	match the identified system. For a modified structure, similar to
	the original, the mass and stiffness matrix perturbations are assumed
	constant, and are used in a second perturbation expansion to generate
	predictions of frequency and mode shape perturbations for the modified
	structure. The stochastic nature of the structure and identification
	procedure enable first and second order statistics of the frequency
	and mode shape perturbations to be generated. These are used in a
	mixed-\&mu; analysis which provides a measure of the stability of
	the system in feedback with controllers. The mixed-\&mu; analysis
	is used to determined critical uncertain parameters which can be
	emphasized in robust control design},

@article{Miller_ACC95,
	Annote = {The Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE) is a United States Space
	Shuttle flight experiment which flew on STS-67 in March of 1995.
	MACE was designed by the Space Engineering Research Center at the
	Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Payload
	Systems Incorporated, the NASA Langley Research Center, and Lockheed
	Missiles and Space Company. The goal is to explore approaches to
	achieving high precision pointing and vibration control of future
	spacecraft and satellites. In particular, MACE extends the bandwidth
	of conventional rigid body instrument pointing and attitude controllers
	to include the flexible modes of the satellite. Since the success
	of such control is intimately dependent upon the accuracy of the
	spacecraft model used for control design, MACE is essentially a spacecraft
	modeling validation effort where success is determined by the control
	performance and predictability that is achieved in Earth orbit. MACE
	builds upon the concept of the Middeck O-Gravity Dynamics Experiments
	(MODE), which flew on STS-40, STS-48 and STS-62 as a dynamics test
	facility to characterize fluid, Space Station structure, and crew
	motion dynamics in zero-gravity. MACE augments the MODE facility
	with real-time digital control capabilities},

	Annote = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate robust compensators designed
	using Popov controller synthesis on the Middeck Active Control Experiment
	(MACE): a Shuttle program scheduled for flight in January, 1995.
	The experiment has been designed to investigate the extent to which
	the on-orbit behavior of a precision-controlled spacecraft can be
	predicted and controlled using analysis and ground testing prior
	to launch. Previous flight experiments indicate that, on-orbit, the
	structural dynamics can change significantly, and that these changes
	are very difficult to predict. Thus the need arises for robust control
	techniques that can guarantee on-orbit performance for flexible spacecraft
	even though the models have large parameter uncertainties. Such a
	technique is developed in this paper using the Popov stability criterion
	from absolute stability theory. A state space representation of the
	stability analysis test is combined with an \&Hscr;<sub>2</sub> performance
	objective to provide a powerful technique for robust controller synthesis.
	A numerical algorithm for optimizing the controller gains and stability
	multipliers is discussed. Several experimental results on MACE are
	used to demonstrate that Popov controller synthesis guarantees robustness
	to real parameter variations and yields good performance with respect
	to the reference LQG designs },

	Abstract = {The Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE) is a space shuttle flight
	experiment intended to demonstrate high authority active structural
	control in zero gravity (0-g) conditions based on analysis and ground
	testing. Finite element structural models are very important for
	the MACE program because they can be used to predict the on-orbit
	dynamics of the test article. However, finite element models tend
	to be inaccurate, requiring the use of parameter robust control techniques
	to achieve good performance. Several such control techniques and
	an overall design methodology are discussed in this paper. Experimental
	results from several tests are used to illustrate the feasibility
	of achieving good /spl Hscr//sub 2/ performance on the test article
	with robust controllers based on the finite element model. This demonstration
	improves confidence in the eventual on-orbit performance of this
	experiment and other future spacecraft.},

	Annote = {A recent approach to robust control design with real parameter uncertainty
	has been to use the analysis results from absolute stability theory.
	Current work has focused on the Popov stability criterion and its
	extensions because linearized forms of the parameter-dependent Lyapunov
	functions restrict the allowable time-variations of the parameter
	errors. This paper builds on recent analysis results, and presents
	a homotopy synthesis technique for robust controllers that minimise
	an overbound of an H<inf>2</inf> performance objective. The optimal
	compensator and multiplier are designed simultaneously, which avoids
	the need to iterate between controller design and optimal multiplier
	evaluation. The procedure is applied to two and four mass benchmark
	problems. The results of these examples illustrate the good guaranteed
	robust performance that can be achieved using this Popov controller
	synthesis (combined H<inf>2</inf>/real {\^A}¿) algorithm.},

@article{osterreicher93,
	Abstract = { In analogy with the definition of Shannon information, M.H. De Groot
	(1962) defined statistical information as the difference between
	prior and posterior risk of a statistical decision problem. Relations
	are studied between the statistical information and the discrimination
	functions of information theory known as f-divergences. Using previous
	results, it is shown that every f-divergence I/sub f/(P,Q) is an
	average statistical information or decision problem with dichotomic
	parameter, 0-1 loss function, and corresponding observation distributions
	P and Q. The average is taken over a distribution on the parameter's
	prior probability. This distribution is uniquely determined by the
	function f. The main result is that every f-divergence is statistical
	information in some properly chosen statistical decision problem,
	and conversely, that every piece of statistical information is an
	f-divergence. This provides a new representation of discrimination
	functions figuring in signal detection, data compression, coding
	pattern classification, cluster analysis, etc (22 Refs.)},

	Abstract = { In the absence of knowledge of the true density function, Bayesian
	models take the joint density function for a sequence of n random
	variables to be an average of densities with respect to a prior.
	The authors examine the relative entropy distance D/sub n/ between
	the true density and the Bayesian density and show that the asymptotic
	distance is (d/2)(log n)+c, where d is the dimension of the parameter
	vector. Therefore, the relative entropy rate D/sub n//n converges
	to zero at rate (log n)/n. The constant c, which the authors explicitly
	identify, depends only on the prior density function and the Fisher
	information matrix evaluated at the true parameter value. Consequences
	are given for density estimation, universal data compression, composite
	hypothesis testing, and stock-market portfolio selection (60 Refs.)},

	Abstract = {Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be two probability measures on the same space
	and let $phi$ be the generalized Radon-Nikodym derivative of $P_2$
	with respect to $P_1$. If $C$ is a continuous convex function of
	a real variable such that the $P_1$-expectation (generalized as in
	Section 3) of $C(phi)$ provides a reasonable coefficient of the $P_1$-dispersion
	of $phi$, then this expectation has basic properties which it is
	natural to demand of a coefficient of divergence of $P_2$ from $P_1$.
	A general class of coefficients of divergence is generated in this
	way and it is shown that various available measures of divergence,
	distance, discriminatory information, etc., are members of this class.},
