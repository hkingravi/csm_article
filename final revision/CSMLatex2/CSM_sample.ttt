\begin{table}[t] \caption{Compares the transient response to a step input for different architectures (cascade and two-input) of the dynamic output feedback controller with the same closed-loop poles locations. The full-state feedback (FSFB) result matches the predicted properties closely (limited by  the dominant pole pair assumption), but the cascade dynamic response is significantly different. The closed-loop response using the two-input dynamic output feedback controller discussed later closely matches the predicted values.} \vspace*{.1in}
