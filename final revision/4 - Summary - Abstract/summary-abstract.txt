In this article we address the challenging problem of modeling and monitoring complex stochastic systems that vary in both space and time (spatiotemporally), given a limited number of agents or sensors providing measurements spread out over a large area. We present a novel perspective for solving this problem that brings together kernel-based modeling, systems theory, and Bayesian filtering. First, we demonstrate that spatiotemporal functional evolution can be modeled using stationary kernels with a linear dynamical system layer over their mixing weights. This method has significant advantages over existing work in terms of complexity and usefulness for control and observation applications. Secondly, we show that this model can be utilized to determine sensing locations that guarantee that the hidden state of the functional evolution can be estimated using a Bayesian state estimator (Kalman filter) embedded in the feature space of the kernel model. We provide non-conservative lower bounds on the number of necessary sampling locations and show where they need to by developing fundamental results on observability. Lastly, we show that this model provides access to important structures hidden in the dynamics through Koopman operator theory analysis. This validity of these results is corroborated with experiments on large data sets, both synthetic and real-world.
