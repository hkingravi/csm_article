In this article, we present a new perspective on solving the spatiotemporal monitoring problem that brings together kernel-based modeling, systems theory, and Bayesian filtering. We define the monitoring problem as follows: Given an approximate predictive model of the spatiotemporal phenomena learned using historic data, estimate the current latent state of the phenomena in the presence of uncertainty using as few sensors as possible. Our main contributions are two-fold: first, we demonstrate that spatiotemporal functional evolution can be modeled using stationary kernels with a linear dynamical systems layer on their mixing weights. This method has significant advantages over existing work in terms of complexity and usefulness for control and observation applications. Second, we show that such a model can be
utilized to determine the minimum number and location of sensors that guarantee that the hidden states of functional evolution can be estimated using a Bayesian state-estimator (Kalman filter) that is embedded in the feature space of the kernel model. Lastly, we show that this model provides access to important structures hidden in the dynamics through Koopman operator theory analysis. We utilize real and synthetic datasets from agriculture, weather monitoring, and fluid dynamics to corroborate our approach.
