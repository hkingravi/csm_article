%%% STOP !!!!!! READ THIS FIRST
%%% ---------------------------
%%% Couple of easy rules
%%%
%%% 1)
%%% The convention used for the key is ALWAYS for eg.,
%%% primaryauthor:conference:year
%%% primaryauthor:conference:month:year
%%% Do not abbreviate the author's last name
%%% See below for abbreviations of standard conferences
%%%
%%% 2)
%%% The separator used is ALWAYS ':' the COLON
%%% The file name for the ps or pdf or main tex source file is
%%% primaryauthor_conference_year.[tex|pdf|ps]
%%% primaryauthor_conference_author_year.[tex|pdf|ps]
%%% Use whatever you used in the key to reflect the paper name
%%%
%%% 3)
%%% Always add the keywords [anncontrol|sec|fiasco|h2hinf] to reflect
%%% which project this papers was developed under and also add
%%% keywords [fccf|uavrf] to reflect which laboratory it was
%%% developed in. This is the only way to list papers by
%%% project and lab using the search script.

                 Vehicles (Heli-UAVs) are unable to handle exceptional
                 situations and combinations of simple failures makes it
                 necessary to find remedies for such cases. A Heli-UAV
                 will most likely crash under circumstances like a basic
                 control failure, unless a remote pilot is at control or
                 alternately, a solution is provided for its control
                 reconfiguration. This paper investigates the use of
                 main rotor speed variation as a fault tolerant feature
                 for a Heli-UAV. Specifically, it is shown that the use
                 of main rotor speed, i.e., RPM variations combined with
                 advanced adaptive control architectures can
                 successfully compensate for partial loss of main rotor
                 collective control. The overall concept is illustrated
