@article{Arulampalam,
	Abstract = {Increasingly for many application areas it is becoming important to
	include elements of non-linearity and non-Gaussianity, in order to
	model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover,
	it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both
	from the point of view of storage costs and also for rapid adaptation
	to changing signal characteristics. In this paper we review both
	optimal and suboptimal {Bayesian} algorithms for non-linear/non-Gaussian
	tracking problems, with a focus on Particle lters. Particle lters
	are sequential Monte Carlo methods based upon point mass (or `particle\&\#039;)
	representations of probability densities, which can be applied to
	any state space model, and which generalise the traditional Kalman
	ltering methods. Several variants of the particle lter such as SIR,
	ASIR, and RPF, are introduced within a generic framework of the Sequential
	Importance Sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared
	with the standard EKF through an illustrative example.},

	Abstract = {Exploration involving mapping and concurrent localization in an unknown
	environment is a pervasive task in mobile robotics. In general, the
	accuracy of the mapping process depends directly on the accuracy
	of the localization process. This paper address the problem of maximizing
	the accuracy of the map building process during exploration by adaptively
	selecting control actions that maximize localisation accuracy. The
	map building and exploration task is modeled using an Occupancy Grid
	(OG) with concurrent localization performed using a feature-based
	Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm . Adaptive
	sensing aims at maximizing the map information by simultaneously
	maximizing the expected Shannon information gain (Mutual Information)
	on the OG map and minimizing the uncertainty of the vehicle pose
	and map feature uncertainty in the SLAM process. The resulting map
	building system is demonstrated in an indoor environment using data
	from a laser scanner mounted on a mobile platform.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the notion of kinematic controllability for second-order
	underactuated mechanical systems. For systems satisfying this property,
	the problem of planning fast collision-free trajectories between
	zero velocity states can be decoupled into the computationally simpler
	problems of path planning for a kinematic system followed by time-optimal
	time scaling. While this approach is well known for fully actuated
	systems, until now there has been no way to apply it to underactuated
	dynamic systems. The results in this paper form the basis for efficient
	collision-free trajectory planning for a class of underactuated mechanical
	systems including manipulators and vehicles in space and underwater
	environments.},

	Annote = {In this paper, we consider the problem of task partitioning among
	members of a team of cooperating agents in response to discovery
	of new tasks or potential failures of some agents. We assume that
	information about new targets or agent failures is received by individual
	team members, and communicated asynchronously with delays to the
	rest of the team. These delays create potential differences in information
	across the team of agents. We describe an asynchronous approach to
	coordinating the team response, where individual agents compute modifications
	to assignments based on local information. We show that the asynchronous
	algorithms converge to the same optimal assignments in the presence
	of arbitrary finite communication delays as a centralized information
	approach. We extend the asynchronous protocol to the solution of
	a class of stochastic dynamic resource assignment problems, and show
	asynchronous convergence of the resulting algorithms. Simulations
	illustrate the delays in computing an optimal assignment of tasks
	in response to dynamic events.},

	Abstract = {The problem of automatically tuning multiple parameters for pattern
	recognition Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is considered. This is
	done by minimizing some estimates of the generalization error of
	SVMs using a gradient descent algorithm over the set of parameters.
	Usual methods for choosing parameters, based on exhaustive search
	become intractable as soon as the number of parameters exceeds two.
	Some experimental results assess the feasibility of our approach
	for a large number of parameters (more than 100) and demonstrate
	an improvement of generalization performance.},

@article{ams:cucker,
	Abstract = {In this report the authors study the relationship between approximation
	and learning, emphasizing the primary role of sampling (inductive
	inference). Tools and ideas from linear algebra, probability theory
	and numerical analysis (least squares algorithm) are widely used.
	As the authors say, ``practical results are not the goal of this
	paper. Understanding is.'' With this purpose, they illustrate their
	statements with several examples. The main setting is the following:
	the existence of an ``unknown'' function $f\colon \,X \to Y$ and
	a probability measure $\rho$ allowing one to randomly draw points
	in $X \times Y$ is assumed, such that for $x \in X$ the expected
	value of a randomly drawn point $y \in Y$ is $f(x)$. The (least squares)
	error of $f$ is defined by $$\scr E(f)=\int\_{X \times Y} (f(x)-y)^2
	d\rho.$$ The main goal is to find $f$ minimizing $\scr E(f)$, where
	$f$ is taken from a subfamily $\scr H$ of continuous functions with
	the sup-norm on $X$. Along with the optimizer $f_{\scr H}$ of the
	problem above, the empirical target function $f_{z}$ is considered,
	minimizing the discrete least squares error for a given sample $z
	\in (X \times Y)^m$. Then the error $\scr E(f_{z})$ decomposes as
	a sum of the sample error (which measures how good $f_z$ is as an
	approximation of $f_{\scr H}$), studied in detail in Chapter I, and
	the approximation error, which depends only on $\scr H$ and $\rho$
	(Chapter II). Several estimations on both errors in terms of covering
	numbers are provided. Also, the bias-variance trade-off problem is
	discussed (for larger families $\scr H$ the approximation errors
	decrease, but sample errors increase, and vice-versa). Chapter III
	is devoted to the study of a particular choice of the families $\scr
	H$, which allows the analysis of algorithms from the point of view
	of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.},

@article{Defoort09_RAS,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a decentralized motion planner for a team of nonholonomic
	mobile robots subject to constraints imposed by sensors and the communication
	network. The motion planning scheme consists of decentralized receding
	horizon planners that reside on each vehicle to achieve coordination
	among flocking agents. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is
	that each vehicle only requires local knowledge of its neighboring
	vehicles. The main requirement for designing an optimal conflict-free
	trajectory in a decentralized way is that each robot does not deviate
	too far from its presumed trajectory designed without taking the
	coupling constraints into account. A comparative study between the
	proposed algorithm and other existing algorithms is provided in order
	to show the advantages, especially in terms of computing time. Finally,
	experiments are performed on a team of three mobile robots to demonstrate
	the validity of the proposed approach.},

	Annote = {We present a control algorithm for autonomous underwater robots with
	modular thruster configuration. The algorithm can handle arbitrary
	thruster configurations. It maintains the robot's desired attitude
	while solving for translational motion. The attitude can be arbitrarily
	chosen from the special orthogonal group SO$^{3}$ allowing the robot
	all possible orientations. The desired translational velocities can
	be chosen from R$^{3}$ allowing the robot to follow arbitrary trajectories
	underwater. If the robot is not fully holonomic then the controller
	chooses the closest possible solution using least squares and outputs
	the error vector. We verify the controller with experiments using
	our autonomous underwater robot AMOUR. We achieve roll errors of
	1.0 degree (2.1 degrees standard deviation) and pitch errors of 1.5
	degrees (1.8 degrees standard deviation). We also demonstrate experimentally
	that the controller can handle both nonholonomic and fully holonomic
	thruster configurations of the robot. In the later case we show how
	depth can be maintained while performing 360 degree rolls. Further,
	we demonstrate an input device that allows a user to control the
	robot's attitude while moving along a desired trajectory.},

@article{donoho03,
	Abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization
	of scattered data (m(i)) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional
	Euclidean space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding,
	derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the
	manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean
	space R-n, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset Theta
	of Euclidean space R-d. Because Theta does not have to be convex,
	this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations
	than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves
	around a quadratic form H(f) = integral(M)parallel toH(f)(m)parallel
	to(F)(2)dm defined on functions f : M --> R. Here Hf denotes the
	Hessian of f, and H(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian
	over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the
	tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally
	isometric to an open, connected subset of R-d, then H(f) has a (d
	+ 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions
	and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric
	coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up
	to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification
	of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification
	of the {Laplacian} eigen-maps framework, where we substitute a quadratic
	form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the {Laplacian}.},

	inference in models which place parametric priors on large numbers
	of targets becomes computationally intractable. As an alternative
	to parametric models, we explore the utility of nonparametric Bayesian
	methods, specifically Dirichlet processes, which allow us to put
	a flexible, data-driven prior on the number of targets present in
	our observations. Dirichlet processes provide a prior on partitions
	of the observations among targets whose dynamics are individually
	described by state space models. These partitions represent the tracks
	with which the observations are associated. We provide preliminary
	data association results for the implementation of Dirichlet processes
	in this scenario.},

	to support a team of ground vehicles performing a collaborative task.
	We propose a gradient-based control approach where agents' positions
	locally minimize a physically motivated cost function. The contributions
	of this paper are threefold. We formulate of a cost function that
	incorporates a continuous, physical model of signal quality, SIR.
	We develop a non-smooth gradient-based controller that positions
	aerial vehicles to acheive optimized signal quality amongst all vehicles
	in the system. This controller is provably convergent while allowing
	for non-differentiability due to agents moving in or out of communication
	with one another. Lastly, we guarantee that given certain initial
	conditions or certain values of the control parameters, aerial vehicles
	will never disconnect the connectivity graph. We demonstrate our
	controller on hardware experiments using AscTec Hummingbird quadrotors
	and provide aggregate results over 10 trials. We also provide hardware-in-the-loop
	and MATALB simulation results, which demonstrate positioning of the
	aerial vehicles to minimize the cost function H and improve signal-quality
	amongst all communication links in the ground/air robot team.},

@article{Graovac03,
	Abstract = { The possibility of fusion of navigation data obtained by two separate
	navigation systems (strap-down inertial one and dynamic vision based
	one) is considered in this paper. The attention is primarily focused
	on principles of validation of separate estimates before their use
	in a combined algorithm. The inertial navigation system (INS) based
	on sensors of medium level quality has been analyzed on one side,
	while a visual navigation method is based on the analysis of a sequence
	of images of ground landmarks produced by an on-board TV camera.
	The accuracy of INS estimations is being improved continuously by
	optimal estimation of a flying object's angular orientation while
	the visual navigation system offers discrete corrections during the
	intervals of presence of landmarks inside the camera's field of view.
	The concept is illustrated by dynamic simulation of a realistic flight
	scenario.},

	Annote = {We describe an efficient, reliable, and robust four-rotor flying
	platform for indoor and outdoor navigation. Currently, similar platforms
	are controlled at low frequencies due to hardware and software limitations.
	This causes uncertainty in position control and unstable behavior
	during fast maneuvers. Our flying platform offers a 1 kHz control
	frequency and motor update rate, in combination with powerful brushless
	DC motors in a light-weight package. Following a minimalistic design
	approach this system is based on a small number of low-cost components.
	Its robust performance is achieved by using simple but reliable highly
	optimized algorithms. The robot is small, light, and can carry payloads
	of up to 350g},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the possibility and necessity of multistep trajectory
	planning in Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based SLAM is investigated.
	The objective of the trajectory planning here is to minimize the
	estimation error of the robot and landmark locations subject to a
	given time horizon. We show that the problem can be regarded as an
	optimization problem for a gradually identified model. A numerical
	method is proposed
	
	for trajectory planning using a variant of the nonlinear Model Predictive
	Control (MPC). The proposed method is optimal in the sense that the
	control action is computed using all the information available at
	the time of decision making. Simulation results are included to compare
	the results from the one-step look-ahead trajectory planning and
	the proposed multi-step lookahead technique.},

	(VRP), in which not all customers have to be serviced nor all the

	VRP instance are forced to satisfy a set of complex high-level tasks
	given as a Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) specification. For the resulting
	Vehicle Routing Problem with Metric Temporal Logic Specifications
	(VRPMTL), a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) based algorithm
	is provided that solves the problem to optimality. Examples for optimal
	multi-{UAV} mission planning is provided where MTL is used as a high
	level language to specify complex mission tasks.},

@inproceedings{kim10_ICRA,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a new algorithm for cooperative and persistent
	simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using multiple robots.
	Recent pose graph representations have proven very successful for
	single robot mapping and localization. Among these methods, incremental
	smoothing and mapping (iSAM) gives an exact incremental solution
	to the SLAM problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem
	in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel extension to iSAM
	to facilitate online multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose graphs.
	Our main contribution is a relative formulation of the relationship
	between multiple pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem
	and leads to an efficient solution when compared to a completely
	global formulation. The relative pose graphs are optimized together
	to provide a globally consistent multi-robot solution. Efficient
	access to covariances at any time for relative parameters is provided
	through iSAM, facilitating data association and loop closing. The
	performance of the technique is illustrated on various data sets
	including a publicly available multi-robot data set. Further evaluation
	is performed in a collaborative helicopter and ground robot experiment.},

@inproceedings{Kuwata2006a,
	Abstract = {Motivated by recent research on cooperative {UAV}s, this paper introduces
	a new decentralized trajectory optimization approach for systems
	with independent dynamics but coupled constraints. The primary objective
	is to improve the performance of the entire fleet by solving local
	optimization problems and without reproducing the global optimization
	problem for each agent. To achieve cooperation, the approach exploits
	the sparse structure of active couplings that is inherent in the
	trajectory optimization. This enables each local optimization to
	use a low-order parameterization of the other agents' states, thereby
	facilitating negotiation while keeping the problem size small. The
	key features of this approach include: (a) no central negotiator
	is required; and (b) it maintains feasibility over the iterations,
	so the algorithm can be stopped at any time. Furthermore, the local
	optimizations are shown to always decrease the overall cost. Simulation
	results are presented to compare the distributed, centralized and
	other (non-cooperative) decentralized approaches in terms of both
	computation and performance},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a control scheme that combines trajectory planning
	and gaze direction control for robotic exploration is presented.
	The objective is to calculate the gaze direction and simultaneously
	plan the trajectory of the robot over a given time horizon, so that
	localization and map estimation errors are minimized while the unknown
	environment is explored. Most existing approaches perform a greedy
	optimization for the trajectory generation only over the next time
	step and usually neglect the limited field of view of visual sensors
	and consequently the need for gaze direction control. In the proposed
	approach an information-based objective function is used, in order
	to perform multiple step planning of robot
	
	motion, which quantities a trade-off between localization, map accuracy
	and exploration. Relative entropy is used as an information metric
	for the gaze direction control. The result is an intelligent exploring
	mobile robot, which produces an
	
	accurate model of the environment and can cope with very uncertain
	robot models and sensor measurements.},

	Abstract = {A gaze direction planning algorithm for Simultaneous Localization
	and Mapping (SLAM), is presented. The objective of the algorithm
	is to calculate the gaze direction which minimizes estimation error
	over a given time horizon. This is made possible by gathering data
	so that the expected information gain is maximized. Existing approaches
	perform a greedy optimization only over the next time step and usually
	neglect the limited field of view of the sensors. In the proposed
	approach information gain is used as an objective function, in order
	to perform multiple step planning. This way, the novel gaze direction
	strategy anticipates all possible trajectories and viewing angles
	over a specific time horizon, performing better than other existing
	approaches when it comes to sensors with limitations, as most visual
	ones. Relative entropy of the covariance matrix provided by the extended
	Kalman filter (EKF) SLAM algorithm
	
	is used, as an information metric for each possible gaze direction
	during the multi-step planning. The aim is to create an intelligent
	perception module which can provide a robot with an accurate environmental
	model. Such a perception module is especially suited for vision-based
	humanoid robots.},

	dynamic vehicle routing problems, known as the multiple-vehicle dynamic
	traveling repairperson problem (m-DTRP), in which demands arrive
	randomly over time and their locations have an arbitrary distribution,
	and the objective is to minimize the average waiting time between
	the appearance of a demand and the time it is visited by a vehicle.
	The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized,
	a-priori task assignment, and are therefore of limited applicability
	in scenarios involving large ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles.
	By combining results from geometric probability and locational optimization,
	we provide a policy that solves, providing a constant-factor approximation
	to the optimal achievable performance, the decentralized version
	of the m-DTRP; such policy (i) does not rely on centralized and a
	priori task assignment, (ii) is spatially distributed, scalable to
	large networks, and adaptive to network changes. Simulation results
	are presented and discussed.},

@conference{Pavone09,
	Annote = {In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which
	there are multiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands
	of each class arrive in the environment randomly over time and require
	a random amount of on-site service that is characteristic of the
	class. To service a demand, one of the vehicles must travel to the
	demand location and remain there for the required on-site service
	time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by the
	expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and
	that demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing
	policy for the service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination
	of the delays for each class. First, we provide a lower bound on
	the achievable values of the convex combination of delays. Then,
	we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its performance under
	heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the service
	vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy
	performs within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the
	optimal), where the constant depends only on the number of classes,
	and is independent of the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of
	demands, the on-site service times, and the convex combination coefficients.},

	agents, which provides guaranteed collision-free paths for the agents
	towards their desired destinations. The algorithm is run locally
	on the agents, which can exchange information using wireless communication.
	The algorithm is robust with respect to arbitrary delays in the wireless
	traffic, possible sources being transmission time, error correction,
	and others. Agents move on reserved areas which are guaranteed not
	to intersect, therefore ensuring safety. The basic algorithm is augmented
	by the introduction of waypoints, which increase performance at the
	cost of additional wireless traffic. The algorithm is successfully
	implemented in simulation and on a real system of autonomous robots.
	The results are presented and discussed.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents <span class='snippet'>a</span> <span class='snippet'>decentralized</span>
	<span class='snippet'>approach</span> <span class='snippet'>to</span>
	path planning for large numbers of autonomous vehicles in sparse
	environments. Unlike existing <span class='snippet'>approaches</span>,
	which are either computationally expensive or communication intensive,
	the presented <span class='snippet'>approach</span> allows large
	numbers of vehicles <span class='snippet'>to</span> plan independently
	with low communication overhead. The key <span class='snippet'>to</span>
	the algorithm is <span class='snippet'>to</span> observe that, in
	sparse environments, collisions are exceptional and that most of
	the time vehicles will simply not hit each other. Hence, it is reasonable
	<span class='snippet'>to</span> allow vehicles <span class='snippet'>to</span>
	plan independently and then resolve the small number of conflicts.
	We operationalize this by having each vehicle send their planned
	paths <span class='snippet'>to</span> <span class='snippet'>a</span>
	small number of their team mates via tokens. Each team member is
	required <span class='snippet'>to</span> check for conflicting paths
	that they have been informed about via <span class='snippet'>a</span>
	token and inform those involved when any conflict is detected. Both
	analytic and empirical results show that the <span class='snippet'>approach</span>
	has very high probability of detecting all potential collisions for
	large numbers of vehicles in both 2D and 3D environments.},

	arrangement of radial/circular and longitudinal muscle groups of
	Oligochaeta. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible
	braided mesh-tube structure with NiTi coil actuators. A numerical
	model for the mesh structure describes how peristaltic motion induces
	robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction
	of NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled,
	tested, and compared on the basis of locomotion speed. The entire
	mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand
	significant external impacts during locomotion. This approach can
	enable a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible
	control unit and energy sources.},

	Annote = {A novel decision-estimation architecture for a team of agents cooperating
	under communication imperfections is presented. The scenario of interest
	is that of a group of uninhabited aerial vehicles performing cooperative
	task assignment under communication delays. In the proposed architecture,
	each {UAV} in the group runs multiple filters in parallel on: its
	own states, teammates' states, and its states as viewed by teammates.
	The estimation of team members' states allows each {UAV} to synchronize
	the transmitted cost of performing known tasks, obtained from the
	different group members, to a common time base. It also enables estimating
	the expected cost for teammates to prosecute new tasks. Thus, the
	group performance, under communication imperfections, can be improved.
	For the estimation, two different algorithms are proposed. The first
	is communication efficient in which asynchronous information updates
	are sent to the network by individual members based on the value
	of the information to the rest of the group. Taking into account
	that the plan and plant of each {UAV} are known to the rest of the
	group, improves the overall estimation process. Moreover, it allows
	proposing another, computationally efficient, estimation algorithm
	utilizing synchronous information updates.},

	Abstract = {It is well-known that the Kalman filter for simultaneous localization
	and mapping (SLAM) converges to a fully correlated map in the limit
	of infinite time and data [REF_REMOVED]. However, the rate of convergence
	of the map has a strong dependence on the order of the observations.
	We show that conventional exploration algorithms for collecting map
	data are sub-optimal in both the objective function and choice of
	optimization procedure. We show that optimizing the a-optimal information
	measure results in a more accurate map than existing approaches,
	using a greedy, closed-loop strategy. Secondly, we demonstrate that
	by restricting the planning to an appropriate policy class, we can
	tractably find non-greedy, global planning trajectories that produce
	more accurate maps, explicitly planning to close loops even in open-loop
	scenarios.},

	Review = {Brief but satisfactory motivation for using the A-optimality metric; refer to this paper more for better description of the difference between A- and D-optimality metrics. Also provides an interesting global planner for grid world without sensor obstacle occlusion ( and possibly without FOV) issues. Describes the problem in terms of a {{POMDP}}, then skips {{POMDP}} approximate solution methods in favor of graph-search methods that exploit structure of the environment, as well as an imposed prohibition on state revisitation, which eases the exponential computational burden. Questions arise over degree of performance loss as a result of the state revisitation prohibition; and the need for a replanning strategy, which is not employed for computational reasons.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for sequential learning of increasingly complex
	graphical models for discriminating between two hypotheses. We generate
	forests for each hypothesis, each with no more edges than a spanning
	tree, which optimize an information-theoretic criteria. The method
	relies on a straightforward extension of the efficient max-weight
	spanning tree (MWST) algorithm by incorporating multivalued edge-weights.
	Each iteration produces nested forests with increasing number of
	edges; each provably optimal as compared to alternative forests.
	Empirical results demonstrate superior probability of error as compared
	to generative approaches.},

@article{vert02treekernel,
	Abstract = {Motivation: The phylogenetic profile of a protein is a string that
	encodes the presence or absence of the protein in every fully sequenced
	genome. Because proteins that participate in a common structural
	complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated
	fashion, the phylogenetic profiles of such proteins are often similar'
	or at least related' to each other. The question we address in this
	paper is the following: how to measure the similarity' between two
	profiles, in an evolutionarily relevant way, in order to develop
	efficient function prediction methods? Results: We show how the profiles
	can be mapped to a high-dimensional vector space which incorporates
	evolutionarily relevant information, and we provide an algorithm
	to compute efficiently the inner product in that space, which we
	call the tree kernel. The tree kernel can be used by any kernel-based
	analysis method for classification or data mining of phylogenetic
	profiles. As an application a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained
	to predict the functional class of a gene from its phylogenetic profile
	is shown to perform better with the tree kernel than with a naive
	kernel that does not include any information about the phylogenetic
	relationships among species. Moreover a kernel principal component
	analysis (KPCA) of the phylogenetic profiles illustrates the sensitivity
	of the tree kernel to evolutionarily relevant variations. Availability:
	All data and software used are freely and publicly available upon

@article{Yuan09_ICIA,
	Annote = {When autonomous vehicles are deployed to perform transportation tasks
	within a confined space and strict time constraint, the problem of
	optimizing the assignment of tasks to vehicles is complicated by
	the need to ensure safety (they do not collide with or impede each
	other) and maximize the efficiency and productivity. With the increasing
	number of autonomous vehicles in practical settings, the ability
	to schedule tasks in a manner that inherently considers the effects
	of task allocations on space contention (which in turn compromises
	efficiency) is important to performance improvement. The main contribution
	of this paper is an approach to simultaneously conduct dynamic task
	allocation and collision-free path planning in an environment where
	multiple autonomous vehicles operate on a network of paths and where
	each path segment can only be occupied by one vehicle at a given
	instant. In particular, a generic algorithm for effective task allocation
	is investigated and applied in conjunction with an application-specific
	objective function. The proposed approach is able to solve the dynamic
	scheduling, planning and collision avoidance problem in an integrated
	way such that the overall productivity of the transportation system
	is improved. Simulation results based on a real-world industrial
	material handling environment demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
	of the proposed method.},

	Annote = {Our prior work {$[$}1{$]$} presented a decentralized algorithm for
	coordinating the construction of a truss structure out of multiple
	components. In this paper, we discuss adaptation in decentralized
	construction. We partition construction in two tasks, tool delivery
	and assembly. Each task is performed by a networked team of specialized
	robots. We analyze the performance of the algorithms using the balls
	into bins problem, and show their adaptation to failure of robots,
	dynamic constraints, multiple types of elements and reconfiguration.
	The algorithms can be used for general types of source elements.},

	differs from other methods by using an inexpensive Wii remote camera,

	onboard microcontroller and the system does not require stationary
	sensors. The only requirements are a stationary pattern of four infrared
	spots at the start and landing site and a roll and pitch attitude
	estimation of sufficient quality, provided by an separate inertial
